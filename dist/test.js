    summary: "When Sam came back to the facility to shut down the Goa’uld forceshield, she'd expected to find Colonel O’Neill. She had actually planned on it. No man left behind.But Sam hadn't expected to find a 12 year old kid named Daisy, who was somehow immune to Hathor’s breathing virus and... who had also rejected and killed a Goa’uld symbiote– Hathor herself, when Hathor had tried taking her over as a host.She and Col. O'Neill had brought Daisy back home... and then things had gone wrong. Daisy was dying. Desperate, Sam and Jack used Ancient Technology to save Daisy, setting off a chain of events that would change their lives, the SGC, Earth, their galaxy and the universe.&nbsp;Daisy didn't remember much from before Hathor had woken her up and tried to take over her body. Just her name and a few other things.The next time she'd woken up, she'd met Sam and Jack. They'd escaped back to Earth, and she'd tried settling in there... and the next thing she knew, Sam and Jack had done something that changed things between all three of them.She'd gained (regained?) her powers... and now, Daisy had to grow up- again (puberty, ugh.), but hey! atleast she liked the Stargate Programme and the SGC.",
    notes: "So… this is my first crossover fusion. If you guys have seen Agents of SHIELD, then… the story starts from 6x13, during the different dimensional/planetary wormhole that Izel and Sarge were using? The rest of the AoS cast’s fate’s are unknown, May is assumed dead, and the rest is probably the same. So, I take canon at the middle of 6x13… so, just before May and Izel fight in that other dimension, Izel and May come out of the dimensional gateway and Sarge is taunting Daisy. After Yo-Yo turns, and tries to kill Mack?This story has a backstory, and I will explain how the story connects, but it’s way, way into the story, but you guys will find out about it as you read.In the case of SG-1, I’m considering S3 as my starting point (specifically 3x01), and I will follow the SG-1 timeline, but with the inclusion of Daisy. I think that Daisy deserves a good family and a place where she can thrive. The AoS universe was… well, it has a lot of flaws… and while the SG universe does too, I think that this will be a healthier universe for Daisy to be in.There is no specific character bashing in this story, though there is a lot of Fitz-Simmons and SHIELD criticism, so… fans of Fitzsimmons, beware.This fic has been inspired by two others, Going Home through a Starry Mirror, --&gt;  LINK    and I have taken the author’s permission to pursue a few similar storylines. The second story that I have taken inspiration from XSGCOM… --&gt;  LINK  which is another great series, but I’m not copying any of XSGCOM’s ideas outright. I recommend both stories if you’re an SG-1 fan like I am.Update schedule is probably one chapter per two weeks. Not sure.Warnings will be posted for each chapter, but if I miss something, please let me know. TW start and end are posted with TWS and TWE, respectively. Search it using search function (Ctrl+F, usually) in a page, then skip it. If there is some plot stuff enclosed in the TW tags, comment down below and I'll fill you in. If it's long, then I'll add a summary in the bottom notes.TW for ch1: Underage Non-con? Not really sure, but I've given the warning. Some graphic violence. Not too much.Enjoy!",
